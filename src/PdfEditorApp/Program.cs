    /// service methods still block a pooled thread on sync-over-async I/O (OCR, PDF
    /// linearization). Past <see cref="Environment.ProcessorCount"/> the pool only injects
    /// roughly one thread every 500ms, so an interaction that fans out several work items
    /// while others sit blocked leaves the rest waiting on injection rather than on CPU.
    ///
    /// That delay is not only a UI-responsiveness problem here: plugins run in-process and may
    /// schedule their own non-real-time work (metadata scans, decode read-ahead) on the same
    /// pool, and starving that work is what turns into an audible gap for an audio plugin.
